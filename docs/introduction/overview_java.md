CKB SDK integrates **CKB**, **CKB indexer** and **Mercury** that encapsulates cryptographic algorithms, RPC services to support the development of DApps like wallets, mining pools.

:::note

The knowledge of CKB Data Model (see [Nervos CKB Reference](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction) and [CKB RFC: CKB Data Structures](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0019-data-structures/0019-data-structures.md)) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/tree/develop/rpc) are must-have skills for developing DApps by using CKB SDKs.

ckb-sdk-java is still under development and **NOT** production ready.
