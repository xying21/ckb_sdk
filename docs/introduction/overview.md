CKB SDKs targeting at different programming languages encapsulate **cryptographic algorithms**, **RPC** and **smart contracts** to support developers to develop a CKB DApp quickly and easily.

<!--These SDKs can enable the DApp to interact with a local or a remote CKB node more efficiently.-->

:::note

The knowledge of CKB Data Model (see [Nervos CKB Reference](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction) and [CKB RFC: CKB Data Structures](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0019-data-structures/0019-data-structures.md)) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/tree/develop/rpc) are must-have skills for developing DApps by using CKB SDKs.
